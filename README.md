# design-patterns
Various sample projects experimenting with design patterns.
At the moment I am working through three books dealing with different aspects of Design Patterns. Elements of Programming Interviews which covers algorithm design patterns. Head First Design Patterns and the original GoF Design Patterns book which both deal with OOP Design Patterns.

This repository will be used initially to track my progress through these excellent books. However, eventually it will also be a place where I experiement with new patterns or ways of designing software for example the: Beyond Design Patterns methodology by Anthony Ferrara.
